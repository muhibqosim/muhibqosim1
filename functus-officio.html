   <!--<h2 class="font-bold text-lg md:text-5xl"> 1.0 Introduction</h2>-->
   <p class="mt-2.5  ">It is a cardinal principle of jurisprudence that, when a court has made a decision in respect of a matter brought under its inherent power, such a court becomes, by operation of the law, functus officio. The principle of functus officio has been defined in the Blacks Law Dictionary as a situation where an officer or official body is without further authority or legal competence because the duties and functions of the original commission have been fully accomplished.</p>
   <p class="mt-2.5  ">To further buttress the point, the courts have made numerous attempts at defining the term. In the Supreme Court decided case of DINGYADI V INEC (No.1) (2011) 18 NWLR Part 1224, Page 1, at 186 Para D-F, per Chuwuma-Eneh JSC, held that:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"> <i class=" ">"…the principle of functus officio ... connotes that a Court as this Court having given its decision in a matter before it ceases to have the power to reopen the same matter all over again in the same proceedings… And so, the Court becomes functus officio and incapable of giving any decision or making any competent orders with regard to the same matter it has previously decided for want of the jurisdiction to do so."</i></p>
   <p class="mt-3">In a coda, once a court makes an order or gives judgement in an action, it becomes functus officio and ceases to possess the power to vary or review such an order or judgment. However, there are exceptions to this rule, which lie in two circumstances: (a) the circumstance of the slip rule, and (b) the circumstance of setting aside its judgement. See MOHAMMED v. APC and ORS (2019) LPELR-CA/K/137/2019 and CITEC INTERNATIONAL ESTATE LTD. AND ORS v. FRANCIS AND ORS (2014) LPELR-SC.116/2011. </p>
   <p class="mt-3 ">This position of the law on the moment when a court is deemed functus officio and the slip rule exception was equally visited by the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal in the case of HOLBORN (NIGERIA) LTD. v. O.C.C. ENTERTAINMENT LTD. [2015] 1 NWLR 451 appearing on the face of the image attached to this weekly nugget. </p>
   <p class="mt-3">The fact culminating in the appeal before the Court of Appeal is simply that the trial court delivered its judgement on the 13th day of October 2006 in a suit in favour of the respondent (then, the plaintiff)—O. C. Chris Enterprises Nigeria Limited. Among the reliefs the Respondent sought in his amended statement of claim against the Appellant (then, the Defendant) at trial court was:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"> <i class=" ">"An inquiry as to damages or at the plaintiff’s option, an account of the profits made by the defendant whether by itself and all other persons and firms howsoever described which the plaintiff know and those it cannot identify by reason of the infringement of plaintiff’s copyright or proprietary right in the use of the Kafal Rubber Design by the defendant and all such persons and firms. <br>
   OR ALTERNATIVELY, the plaintiff’s claims against the defendant and all the sum of Ten Million Naira (N10,000,000) as general damages for the defendant’s infringement of the plaintiff’s proprietary right to the use of the registered number 5528 by producing for sale and distribution, the textile products carrying thee. Kafal Rubber Design."</i></p>
   <p class="mt-3">In granting the entire reliefs prayed for by the Respondent at the trial court, the trial court ordered, inter alia, as follows:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"><i> "(e) An inquiry as to damages or at the Plaintiffs option, an account of the profits made by the Defendant whether by itself and all other persons and firms howsoever described which the Plaintiff know and those it can not identify by reason of the infringement of Plaintiffs copy right or proprietary right in the use of the KAFAL RUBBER DESIGN by the Defendant and all such persons and firms."</i></p>
   <p class="mt-3">The learned trial judge perhaps mistakenly omitted to include the award of ₦10,000,000 (Ten Million Naira) in favour of the Respondent as alternatively prayed.</p>
   <p class="mt-3">Due to the reluctance of the Appellant (then the defendant) to comply with the order of the court, the respondent subsequently, via a Motion on Notice dated 11th July, 2007, sought the following orders:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"><i class="">    "1. An order requiring the judgment debtor/respondent to explain the delay in submitting, delivering and vouching an account in this matter as directed by this honourable court in its judgment dated 13th October,2006. <br>
         2.     An order giving such directions as the court may deem fit with regard to the manner in which the account is to be taken or vouched. <br> 
         3.     An order directing the expediting of the submission delivery and vouching of the said account to wit: that the judgment debtor/respondent do submit, deliver and vouch the said account within 7 days of the making of the orders by the court. <br>
         4.     And such order or further orders as the court may deem fit to make in the circumstances of this case."</i> </p>
   <p class="mt-3">However, in the course of giving its ruling on the 4th day of October, 2007 on the motion on notice filed by the Respondent, the trial court observed that there was an error in the judgement earlier delivered on the 13th day of October, 2006, not including the alternative relief sought by the Appellant. The trial court, having noted the error, made the following comment:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"> <i class="">"In the interim, this court perused the contents of the judgment and orders delivered on the said date in open court and discovered certain clerical errors and omissions which need clarification presently. It is now well settled beyond any doubt that where a judgment is in need of clarification or correction in respect of clerical slips, errors or omission, there is power under the law for the same court that delivered the judgment to correct the clerical slips, errors or accidental omission."</i>  </p>
   <p class="mt-3">In support of its decision, the court cited the following: Federal Public Trustee v. Mrs. C. A. Sobamowo (1967) NMLR P.350, among others, vis-à-vis Sections 251 and 252 of the 1999 Constitution and Order 27-7 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2000. The trial court further held that:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"><i>"Accordingly, from the foregoing paragraphs of this ruling, the judgment of this court dated 13th day of October 2006, order are hereby amended to reflect the said accidental slips, clerical errors and omissions therein pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of this court as provided for in the above mentioned sections of the 1999CFRN and the FHC (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2000."</i></p>
   <p class="mt-3">In effect, the trial court, in its ruling on the said motion on notice, on its own volition and without any application being brought before it, amended the judgement that it had delivered a year earlier on the ground that it discovered clerical errors and omissions that needed clarification.</p>
   <p class="mt-3">Hence, one of the grouses of the appellant at the Court of Appeal was whether the power of the trial judge under Order 27 Rule 7 of the Federal High Court Rules 2000, to correct mistakes or errors arising from any accidental slip or omission, extends to substituting his awards for another and thereby making an award which he had not earlier made, and whether this can be done suo-motu (of its own volition). During the course of the resolution of the issue as raised, the Court of Appeal held that:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"> <i class="">"It is an established principle of law that once a court or tribunal delivered its final judgment in a case before it, it becomes functus officio with respect to that case. It has no power to re-open the case for the purpose of making corrections or changing any opinion expressed in its earlier judgment in the case. The only exception to the rule is where there is need to make minor permissible correction under the slip rule."</i>  </p>
   <p class="mt-3">The Court further continued stating the position of law on altering and varying an earlier judgement when it held that:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"><i class="">"What can be altered under the slip rule is not as to the substance of the judgment earlier delivered that limited in minor errors such as spelling errors, typographical or mathematical errors wherein correct figures can be entered."</i>   </p>
   <p class="mt-3">However, a quick question is to what extent is the applicability of the "slip rule" as an exception to the principle of functus officio?</p>
   <p class="mt-3">The slip rule is one of the two exceptions to the circumstances in which a court becomes functus officio. The slip rule, as defined by Ariwoola, is the power given to a court of law to correct or amend the terms of its own orders or judgements to effect such variations therein in such a way as to carry out the meaning which the court intended. For instance, if the language used in the phrasing of the order is ambiguous, does not express the order actually made by the judgment, or is otherwise open to misapprehension, it may be corrected to make it clear. See: ENTERPRISES BANK LTD v. AROSO & ORS (2015) LPELR-SC.166/2003(R). And to the extent of the applicability of this rule, the learned wisemen of the Court of Appeal further stated that:</p>
   <p class="mt-1 font-semibold"> <i class="">"What can be altered under the slip rule is not as to the substance of the judgment earlier delivered that limited in minor errors such as spelling errors, typographical or mathematical errors wherein correct figures can be entered."</i>   </p>
   <p class="mt-3">This thus implies that the slip rule, as an exception to functus officio, does not extend to varying the substance of an earlier judicial pronouncement.</p>
   <p class="mt-3">In an addendum, the law also required that, even in such an instance where the Court found a clerical error, correctable under the slip rule, in its previous judgement, the Court still lacks the jurisdiction to correct same suo-motu (by its own volition). The requirement of the law is that such a correction must be predicated on an application brought before the court by either party.</p>
   <p class="mt-3">Thus, in the case at hand, i.e. HOLBORN (NIG.) LTD. v. O.C.C. ENT. LTD. [2015] 1 NWLR 451, it is clear from the record that it was the lower court, of its own volition, that proceeded to embark on correcting its own judgment, as all that the respondent sought in its motion on notice dated 11/7/2007 was for the court to direct the appellant to file an account of profits made by it. The final judgement delivered by the lower court on 13th October, 2023, did not contain any award as to any damages allegedly suffered by the respondent. Even though an application was brought for the correction of the judgement, the trial court still lacks the jurisdiction to have its earlier decision altered for the simple fact that such an alteration made by the trial court is not within the purview of what amounts to the slip rule as an exception to the circumstance where a court becomes functus officio once it delivers its judgement or makes its pronouncements on a subject matter.</p>
